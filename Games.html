					<p>  Hello, in this article I will talk about how solar panels are good for the Earth and how much money it will take to go solar.  While I was looking for information on solar energy I came across an article that stated that the polar ice caps have been decreasing.  Now everyone should have seen on the news or in the paper that the polar ice caps are melting, but you may have not understood why this is happening.  So I will give you two reasons why they are melting.</p>
					
					<p>Number one: since the water is darker than the ice caps most of the heat from the sun hits the water and when it does so the water warms up.  After it warms up it starts to melt the ice.</p>
					
					<p>  Number two: as the atmosphere gets warmer it starts to produce heat, which is also melting the ice caps!</p>
					
					<p>  Thankfully a person named Elon Musk is making a big factory that is called the GigaFactory.  The GigaFactory currently is making batteries for solar panels.  In a small interview I watched, Elon Musk said that 100 of those GigaFactories could power the world.  So after doing some math I came to discover that there are about 14,000 solar panels on this GigaFactory, which is about 1 megawatt of energy.</p>
					
					<p>  Which I believe brings us to the amount of solar panels needed to power the world as well as the cost.  After doing some calculation I have discovered that we will need 98 million solar panels to power the world as it is currently.  To support all these solar panels we will need around 754,600,000 cubic feet of land, which is equivalent to 233,000 football fields!  To pay for all those solar panels we will need around 637 billion dollars!  Now keep in mind that’s only for the solar panels not the repair costs or the setup costs!  To make it sound better to you if everyone in the world could pay roughly 85 dollars then we could buy the solar panels!  Now, you are probably thinking “like, ok well that’s awesome let’s do it right now”, but the problem is, that 85 dollars per person includes poor people therefore those who could afford to would need to pay more.</p>
					<p>  This brings me to pros and cons since all I have talked about is money and what we need.  So here are some facts.  One pro is that a solar panel will only produce 8 pounds of sulfur dioxide, 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides, and about 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide.  Now that is still a lot, but less than an oil rig!  One con is that it will mean less jobs for people. So we will have to make more jobs that are environmentally friendly.  To top it off, if we go solar sooner rather than later then we could maybe keep the polar ice caps as polar ice caps!</p>
					
					<p>  Thank you for spending some of your valuable time reading this article and hopefully you will invest some more of your time into making the world an even better place!</p>
